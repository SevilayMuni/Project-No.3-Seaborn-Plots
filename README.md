# Pandas and Seaborn Mediated Comprehensive Analysis on Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Data Discovering, Structuring, Visualization

This project analyzes several clinicopathologic features of thyroid cancer to acquire results on its pathology and occurrence. 
Thyroid cancer mortality is low; whereas, its recurrence risk is still a significant concern. Analyzing this dataset also provides risk level assessment. 

## Libraries
Python Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn libraries.
## Findings
This data analysis demonstrates the following outcomes:

![image1](https://github.com/SevilayMuni/Project-No.3-ThyroidCancer-DA/blob/main/generated-graphs/Tumor-and-Cancer-Stage-Box-Plots.png)
- With age, the possibility of thyroid cancer invading other tissues increases.
- Thyroid cancer growing outside happens in a wide age range.
- Late-stage cancer diagnosis observed in aged patients. 

![image2](https://github.com/SevilayMuni/Project-No.3-ThyroidCancer-DA/blob/main/generated-graphs/Risk-Level-and-Cancer-Stage-Distributions.png)
- 65% of thyroid cancers possess low risk.
- 87% of thyroid cancers are diagnosed at their first stage.

![image3](https://github.com/SevilayMuni/Project-No.3-ThyroidCancer-DA/blob/main/generated-graphs/Metastasis-and-Pathology-Distributions.png)
- 95% of thyroid cancers are non-metastatic.
- 75% of thyroid cancers are papillary kind.

![image4](https://github.com/SevilayMuni/Project-No.3-ThyroidCancer-DA/blob/main/generated-graphs/Histogram-Age-Distribution.png)
- Thyroid cancer mostly appears in ages between 25-35. 

![image5](https://github.com/SevilayMuni/Project-No.3-ThyroidCancer-DA/blob/main/generated-graphs/Gender-Smoking-Metastasis-Counts-BarGraph.png)
- Thyroid cancer predominantly occurs in females.
- No correlation exists between thyroid cancer and smoking.

![image6](https://github.com/SevilayMuni/Project-No.3-ThyroidCancer-DA/blob/main/generated-graphs/Radiotherapy-TreatmentResponse-Recurrence-Counts-BarGraph.png)
- Most thyroid cancer patients do not receive radiotherapy.
- Treatment response is generally excellent.
- Thyroid cancer recurrence is low.

![image7](https://github.com/SevilayMuni/Project-No.3-ThyroidCancer-DA/blob/main/generated-graphs/Age-vs-Adenopathy-SwarmPlot.png)
- In most thyroid cancer cases, no adenopathy is present. 
- Right side and bilateral adenopathy are not dependent on the patient's age.
- Nonetheless, left-side adenopathy is usually found in patients younger than 50. 

## Table Legend
Smoking History: whether individuals have a history of smoking (Yes or No).

Radiotherapy History: whether individuals have radiotherapy treatment history (Yes or No).

Thyroid Function: thyroid gland status or function.

Physical Examination: Describes the results of a physical examination, likely related to the thyroid.

Adenopathy: presence and location of adenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes).

Thyroid Cancer Pathology: Describes the types of thyroid cancer based on pathology examinations, 
including specific subtypes like "Micropapillary Papillary," "Follicular," and "HÃ¼rthle cell."

Focality: whether the thyroid cancer is unifocal or multifocal.

Risk: risk category associated with thyroid cancer.

Tumor: stage of thyroid cancer, indicating the size and extent of the primary tumor.

Lymph Nodes: indicating the involvement of nearby lymph nodes.

Metastasis: whether the cancer has spread to distant organs.

Stage: Represents the overall stage of thyroid cancer based on T, N, and M stage combination.

Treatment Response: Describes treatment response 
Categories; 'Indeterminate,' 'Excellent,' 'Structural Incomplete,' and 'Biochemical Incomplete.' 

Recurred: Indicates whether thyroid cancer has recurred (e.g., Yes or No).
