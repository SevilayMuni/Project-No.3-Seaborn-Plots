# Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Comprehensive Analysis

This project analyzes several clinicopathologic features of thyroid cancer to acquire results on its pathology and occurrence. 
Thyroid cancer mortality is low; whereas, its recurrence risk is still a significant concern. Analyzing this dataset also provides risk level assessment. 




## Libraries
Python Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn libraries.
## Findings
This data analysis demonstrates the following outcomes:

1A- With age, the possibility of thyroid cancer invading other tissues increases.
1B- Thyroid cancer growing outside happens in a wide age range.
1C- Late-stage cancer diagnosis observed in aged patients. 

2A- 65% of thyroid cancers possess low risk.
2B- 87% of thyroid cancers are diagnosed at their first stage.

3A- 95% of thyroid cancers are non-metastatic.
3B- 75% of thyroid cancers are papillary kind.

4A- Thyroid cancer mostly appears in ages between 25-35. 

5A- Thyroid cancer predominantly occurs in females.
5B- No correlation exists between thyroid cancer and smoking.

6A- Most thyroid cancer patients do not receive radiotherapy.
6B- Treatment response is generally excellent.
6C- Thyroid cancer recurrence is low.

7A- In most thyroid cancer cases, no adenopathy is present. 
7B- Right side and bilateral adenopathy is not dependent on the patient's age.
7C- Nonetheless, left-side adenopathy is usually found in patients younger than 50. 
## Table Legend
Smoking History: whether individuals have a history of smoking (Yes or No).

Radiotherapy History: whether individuals have radiotherapy treatment history (Yes or No).

Thyroid Function: thyroid gland status or function.

Physical Examination: Describes the results of a physical examination, likely related to the thyroid.

Adenopathy: presence and location of adenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes).

Thyroid Cancer Pathology: Describes the types of thyroid cancer based on pathology examinations, 
including specific subtypes like "Micropapillary Papillary," "Follicular," and "HÃ¼rthle cell."

Focality: whether the thyroid cancer is unifocal or multifocal.

Risk: risk category associated with thyroid cancer.

Tumor: stage of thyroid cancer, indicating the size and extent of the primary tumor.

Lymph Nodes: indicating the involvement of nearby lymph nodes.

Metastasis: whether the cancer has spread to distant organs.

Stage: Represents the overall stage of thyroid cancer based on T, N, and M stage combination.

Treatment Response: Describes treatment response 
Categories; 'Indeterminate,' 'Excellent,' 'Structural Incomplete,' and 'Biochemical Incomplete.' 

Recurred: Indicates whether thyroid cancer has recurred (e.g., Yes or No).
